# E-Commerce-API

## Description

- My motivation is to create a database that represent some products with certain characteristics such as the tags and categories.
- I built this project because this project can help others through using api to use the CRUD function to a database.
- The problem that this solve is to provide data to others using api.
- I learn that router must be used to organize the function without using mysql statements.
